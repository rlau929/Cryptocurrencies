# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this module is to understand how to perform unsupervised machine learning on cryptocurrency data. We can form an analysis by grouping similar data into clusters. We also used plotly.express to plot the data using scatter_3d to visually compare each cluster. Additionally, we used the elbow curve to find the best number of K (K represents how many clusters will be present). The module was fun because we were able to create a 3d graph. It was also fun finding out how many clusters there will be. I recommend creating a box plot to find out the standard deviatian of each clusters to better understand the data.
